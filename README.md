# SEPLN-TASS15
Twitter Sentiment Analysis (http://www.daedalus.es/TASS2015/tass2015.php)


TASS is an experimental evaluation workshop for sentiment analysis and online reputation analysis focused on Spanish language, organized as a satellite event of the annual conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN). After three previous successful editions, TASS 2015 will take place on September 15th, 2015 at University of Alicante, Spain.

The aim of TASS is to provide a forum for discussion and communication where the latest research work and developments in the field of sentiment analysis in social media, specifically focused on Spanish language, can be shown and discussed by scientific and business communities. The main objective is to promote the application of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques for sentiment analysis applied to short text opinions extracted from social media messages (specifically Twitter).

Several challenge tasks are proposed, intended to provide a benchmark forum for comparing the latest approaches in these fields. In addition, with the creation and release of the fully tagged corpus, we aim to provide a benchmark dataset that enables researchers to compare their algorithms and systems.
